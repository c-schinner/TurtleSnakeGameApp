# Turtle Snake Game
The Turtle Snake Game is a classic Snake game implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python. Players control a snake to collect food items while avoiding collisions with walls and their own tail. The game features dynamic gameplay, real-time updating, and a scoreboard to track the player's progress.

# Features
Control a snake's movement to collect food and grow.

Avoid collisions with walls and your snake's tail.

Track your score on an interactive scoreboard.

Experience smooth, real-time gameplay using the Turtle graphics library.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

2. Ensure you have the required files (Scoreboard.py, Food.py, Snake.py) in the same directory as your main script.

3. Open a new Python file or interactive environment.

4. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.

5. Run the code. A window will appear displaying the Snake game environment.

6. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.

7. The snake must collect the food items to increase its length and score.

8. If the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, the game ends, and the score resets.

9. Click anywhere on the window to close the game.

# Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game to make it more engaging:

Adjust the screen.setup() values to change the window size.

Modify colors, fonts, and positioning in the Scoreboard class to personalize the scoreboard's appearance.

Customize the snake's colors, shapes, and movement characteristics in the Snake class.

Experiment with food appearance and placement in the Food class.
